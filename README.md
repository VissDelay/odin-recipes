Hi, today i am about to write my first self-made project with TheOdinProject using only HTML.
So far i have learn about more than just coding itself but about how the web works, the basic understanding of the internet, what is git? github?, as a bonus i am also learning on how to use Linux and the CLI and getting more and more fimiliar with using cmd. It also feels very nice I am not gonna lie to ya.

>>Current skills:
** Basic HTML
> listing ul,ol
> using img elements to place and image
> adding text and titles using <p>, <h1> - <h6>
> anchor elements turning text and image into links (relative and absolute links) <a>

** Git 
> basic git commands
